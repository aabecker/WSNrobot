	Abstract = {Many applications for autonomous agents require the agent to have accurate position data. Signal-strength based localization attempts to determine an agent's location in {R^n} from a scalar sensor reading z. This is a nontrivial problem because the mapping from {R^n} to z is noninvertible.
	
Indoor Localization attempts to solve this problem in an indoor environment. This adds challenges. Among these are the effects of signal interference; signal dropout due to walls, doors, and humans; and the expense of data collection.
	
This project implements a localization system on an autonomous system, the Seg-Monster. The SegMonster is a human-sized robot that rides a commercial Segway personal transporter. Local data from wheel-mounted encoders are combined with signal-strength based localization that interprets wireless signal strength using Gaussian processes to calculate a global position estimate.},

@phdthesis{Becker2012a,
	Abstract = {In this dissertation, we apply the framework of ensemble control theory to derive an approximate steering algorithm for two classical robotic systems---the nonholonomic unicycle and the plate-ball manipulator---in the presence of model perturbation that scales all inputs by an unknown but bounded constant.

The basic idea is to maintain the set of all possible configurations and to select inputs that reduce the size of this set and drive it toward some goal configuration. The key insight is that the evolution of this set can be described by a family of control systems that depend continuously on the unknown constant. Ensemble control theory provides conditions under which it is possible to steer this entire family to a neighborhood of the goal configuration with a single open-loop input trajectory. For both the nonholonomic unicycle and the plate-ball manipulator, we show how to construct this trajectory using piecewise-constant inputs. We also validate our approach with hardware experiments, where the nonholonomic unicycle is a differential-drive robot with unknown wheel size, and the plate-ball manipulator is a planar motion stage that uses magnetic actuation to orient a sphere of unknown radius.

We conclude by showing how the same framework can be applied to feedback control of multi-robot systems under the constraint that every robot receives exactly the same control input. We focus on the nonholonomic unicycle, instantiated in experiment by a collection of differential-drive robots. Assuming that each robot has a unique wheel size, we derive a globally asymptotically stabilizing feedback control policy. We show that this policy is robust to standard models of noise and scales to an arbitrary number of robots. These results suggest that our approach may have possible future application to control of micro- and nano-scale robotic systems, which are often subject to similar constraints.

	Abstract = {In this paper we investigate controlling many nonholonomic unicycles that each receive exactly the same inputs.  The robots are almost homogeneous, but each robot has a unique parameter that scales its turning rate.  Previous work showed that such a collection of robots can be approximately steered to arbitrary Cartesian positions, but not to arbitrary heading angles in a global reference frame.  We extend this work by proving we can always steer such a collection of robots exactly to arbitrary range and bearing locations relative to targets in R^2 in a finite number of steps.  We also provide existence proofs for  controlling the final heading angles of many robots.  This work addresses a fundamental challenge in micro- and nanorobotics with possible applications in targeted therapy, sensing, and actuation. Scale hardware experiments validate the control policy.  All code is provided online.},

	Abstract = {Biological robots can be produced in large numbers, but are often controlled by uniform inputs. This makes position control of multiple robots inherently challenging.

This paper uses magnetically-steered ciliate eukaryon (Tetrahymena pyriformis) as a case study.  These cells swim at a constant speed, and can be turned by changing the orientation of an external magnetic field. We show that it is possible to steer multiple T. pyriformis to independent goals if their turning---modeled as a first-order system---has unique time constants.  We provide system identification tools to parameterize multiple cells in parallel.

We construct feedback control-Lyapunov methods that exploit differing phase-lags under a rotating magnetic field to steer multiple cells to independent target positions.
We prove that these techniques scale to any number of cells with unique first-order responses to the global magnetic field. We provide simulations steering hundreds of cells and validate our procedure in hardware experiments with multiple cells.

	Abstract = {Roboticists, biologists, and chemists are now producing large populations of simple robots, but controlling large populations of robots with limited capabilities is  difficult, due to communication and onboard-computation constraints. Direct human control of large populations seems even more challenging.

In this paper we investigate control of mobile robots that move in a 2D workspace using three different system models. We focus on a model that uses broadcast control inputs specified in the global reference frame.

In an obstacle-free workspace this system model is uncontrollable because it has only two controllable degrees of freedom---all robots receive the same inputs and move uniformly. We prove that adding a single obstacle can make the system controllable, for any number of robots. We provide a position control algorithm, and demonstrate through extensive testing with human subjects that many manipulation tasks can be reliably completed, even by novice users, under this system model, with performance benefits compared to the alternate models.

We compare the sensing, computation, communication, time, and bandwidth costs for all three system models. Results are validated with extensive simulations and hardware experiments using over 100 robots.},

The swimmer forms when a liquid suspension of ferro-magnetic micro-particles and a non-magnetic bead are exposed to an alternating magnetic field that is oriented perpendicular to the liquid surface. It can be steered by modulating the frequency of the alternating field. We model the swimmer as a unicycle and learn a mapping from frequency to forward speed and turning rate using locally-weighted projection regression. We apply iterative linear quadratic regulation with a receding horizon to track motion primitives that could be used for path following. Hardware experiments validate our approach.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents CRIC (Cross-Point Regions for Lossless Image Compression), a scheme for losslessly encoding and decoding images, especially medical images, by optimizing on the probability of cross points that neighbor points of grey levels 2n. The base of this statement is the effect of Gray coding on cross points. At first, the effect of Gray codes is determined on an adjacent data set because images characteristically contain data that does not change much in a specific area; then this effect is generalized for real data without losing generality for their statistical properties. This is especially true for medical images that have many regions with the same grey levels. The Gray code transformation makes the bit states of cross points change from the original data bits, so first the probabilities of data bits on specific bit planes in cross point regions and then the entropies of the messages are changed. These probabilities are estimated and compared with the probabilities of the original data bits. This change of probability has important effects on the encoding and decoding processes in lossless medical image compression.},

	Abstract = {The classical problem of robot coverage is to plan a path that brings a point on the robot within a fixed distance of every point in the free space. In the presence of significant uncertainty in sensing and actuation, it may no longer be possible to guarantee that the robot covers all of the free space all the time, and so it becomes unclear what problem we are trying to solve. We will restore clarity by adopting a ``probably approximately correct'' measure of performance that captures the probability 1-delta" of covering a fraction 1-epsilon of the free space. The problem of coverage for a robot with uncertainty is then to plan a feedback policy that achieves a given value of epsilon and delta. Just as solutions to the classical problem are judged by the resulting path length, solutions to our problem are judged by the required execution time. We will show the practical utility of our performance measure by applying it to several examples in simulation.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a state estimator that reliably detects gait events during human walking with a portable powered ankle-foot orthosis (AFO), based only on measurements of the ankle angle and of contact forces at the toe and heel. Effective control of the AFO critically depends on detecting these gait events. A common approach detects gait events simply by checking if each measurement exceeds a given threshold. Our approach uses cross correlation between a window of past measurements and a learned model to estimate the configuration of the human walker, and detects gait events based on this estimate. We tested our approach in experiments with five healthy subjects and with one subject that had neuromuscular impairment. Using motion capture data for reference, we compared our approach to one based on thresholding and to another common one based on k-nearest neighbors. The results showed that our approach reduced the RMS error by up to 40% for the impaired subject and up to 49% for the healthy subjects. Moreover, our approach was robust to perturbations due to changes in walking speed and to control actuation.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents control and coordination algorithms for groups of vehicles. The focus is on autonomous vehicle networks performing distributed sensing tasks, where each vehicle plays the role of a mobile tunable sensor. The paper proposes gradient descent algorithms for a class of utility functions which encode optimal coverage and sensing policies. The resulting closed-loop behavior is adaptive, distributed, asynchronous, and verifiably correct.},
