\section{SeismicDarts}\label{sec:SeismicDarts}

A SeismicDart combines a geophone (GS-100) with the fins and body of a lawn Jart\textsuperscript{TM}, using a 3D-printed chamber that encloses a WiFi-enabled microcontroller (particle.io Photon\textsuperscript{TM}) as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Smart_Dart_overview}. 
The center of the chamber is slotted to fit a wooden plate holding an accelerometer that transmits data wirelessly through the microcontroller. 
The centered accelerometer card allows placing the microcontroller and battery on opposite sides, balancing the dart.
Designs and instructions to build a SeismicDart are available at \cite{Victor2016Thingiverse}.

\subsection{Experiments} 
The following sections compare SeismicDart performance.
\subsubsection{ Drop tests in different soils}  


Proper planting of a geophone requires good contact with the soil and the geophone to be in a vertical position. 
Geophone protocol classifies a geophone as well planted if the angle of deviation is less than 10$^\circ$ and the spike has at least 40 mm of penetration.

To determine how SeismicDarts perform in different soils, this experiment measured penetration depth and angle of deviation in seven different soil types as a function of drop height. 
 The soil types were categorized by compression strength, in kg/cm$^2$, measured using a soil pocket penetrometer (CertifiedMTP). Measurements for compression strength vary with a small deviation in measurement location, so we repeated this measurement 10 times at 10 different locations in each soil type and computed the average.
 
 Experiments were conducted using the Seismic UAV to autonomously drop a payload of four SeismicDarts at the desired drop height. 
 Tests were conducted at drop heights of 10, 15, 20, and 25 m. 
 We measured the angle of deviation and penetration depth for each drop.
 The angular deviation was measured using two protractors.
 We measured penetration depth by marking where the spike met the soil, pulling the dart from the soil, and measuring the distance from the spike tip to the marking with calipers. 
  We repeated this measurement 12 times for each soil type at each drop height.  The soil compression strengths in these experiments ranged from 0.056 kg/cm$^2$ for river sand, to 4 kg/cm$^2$ for a hard-packed soccer field.

Because the four soil types with the lowest soil compression strength could be well-planted with low drop heights, we performed these tests manually. 
We filled 19 liter (5 gal.) buckets with four soil types and dropped the SeismicDart from six heights.
%Penetration depth and angular deviation were measured. %To measure penetration depth, the buried darts were marked where the spike met the soil, the dart was then pulled from the soil, and the distance from the spike tip to the marking was measured with calipers. The angular deviation was recorded using the accelerometer inside the dart.

 
  % These experiments shows that increasing drop height increases penetration on all soils tested.
  % Also, darts dropped in quiescent air remain vertical if they penetrate the soil.
Experiment results plotting penetration depth as a function of drop height are displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:DepthPlotIndoors}, and angle of deviation as a function of drop height in Fig.~\ref{fig:AnglePlotIndoors}.   Both graphs are annotated with values for soil compression strength.

If a SeismicDart is dropped from a sufficient height into penetrable soil, the spike will be buried into the soil and the geophone will have a small angular deviation from vertical. Soils with higher compression strength require higher drop heights. Error bars show that variance decreases with drop height for angle of deviation and penetration depth.  
 All drops from heights 20 m or more achieved the goals of an angle of deviation less than 10$^\circ$ and at least 40 mm of penetration.   

The autonomous tests were conducted with 16 km/hr winds, demonstrating that drop heights 20 m or higher were sufficient to counter disturbances from the wind. %https://www.windfinder.com/forecast/galveston_airport

\subsubsection{Shot gather comparison} 
Geophysical explorationists often use thousands of geophones to conduct a seismic survey. 
 As a proof-of-concept, this experiment ran a small-scale seismic survey to compare the performance of a traditional cabled four geophone system with readings from four autonomously deployed SeismicDarts.
Flying autonomously at a drop height of 25 m, the Seismic UAV flew to GPS waypoints spaced 4 m apart and deployed one dart at each location. 
A seismic survey technician manually planted four traditional cabled geophones, each 10 cm from a deployed SeismicDart. 
A seismic wave was generated using a sledgehammer hitting a steel plate.

Results of the field test comparison between the traditional cabled geophone system and the SeismicDarts are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:shotgather_auto_drop}.   
Data were obtained using a \emph{StrataVisor}, a device that can obtain, store, and plot the sensed data. 
The \emph{StrataVisor} is extensively used with traditional geophone setups because the geophones can only sense vibrational waves and are dependent on other devices for storage and data processing. 
To allow a fair comparison with geophones, the SeismicDart's  ability to store sensed data was not used in this experiment. 
 The \emph{StrataVisor} records the geophone voltage at 2000 Hz, using a 24 bit ADC.

The readings from both systems are qualitatively similar, with no discernible phase or amplitude differences. Let $X$ be measurements from the traditional geophone and $Y$ the corresponding voltages from a SmartDart.
The percent peak-to-peak error and normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE) are defined as
\begin{align}
e_{pp} &= 100 \left( \frac{ \max(X) - \min(X) }{ \max(Y) - \min(Y) } -1\right) \\
  \text{NRMSE} &=\frac{100}{\max(X) - \min(X)} \sqrt{ \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^n \left( X_i - Y_i \right)}{n} }.
\end{align}
The peak-to-peak errors were [-6.33, -1.15, -1.81,  9.84] \% for sensors at [4,8,12,16] m from the source.
 The NRMSE were [1.05,1.27,3.98,4.39] \% for sensors at [4,8,12,16] m from the source.
%$e_{\text{4 m}}  =  -6.3 \%, e_{\text{8 m}}  =  11.93 \%, e_{\text{12 m}}  = -1.81\%, e_{\text{16 m}}  = 0.981 \%$. 
%The RMSD error were $RMSD_{\text{4 m}}  =  -6.3 \%, RMSD_{\text{8 m}}  =  11.93 \%, RMSD_{\text{12 m}}  = \%, RMSD_{\text{16 m}}  = 0.981 \%$. 
Readings were also compared using a Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, which gives a correlation measurement between $-1$ and $+1$ where $+1$ is total positive linear correlation:
\begin{align}
\rho_{X,Y} = \frac{E\left[  (X-\mu_X) (Y-\mu_Y)  \right]}{  \sigma_X, \sigma_Y}.
\end{align}

The correlation coefficients were $\rho_{\text{4 m}}  =  0.9813, \rho_{\text{8 m}}  =  0.9836, \rho_{\text{12 m}}  =  0.8600, \rho_{\text{16 m}}  = 0.8114$. These correlations decrease with distance. The SeismicDart is subject to low-amplitude noise, which is easiest to see in the fourth sensor because it was 16 m from the seismic source and thus had the lowest signal amplitude.  This noise is potentially due to wind striking the SeismicDart's fin. The effect of noise can be mitigated by using larger seismic sources such as a vibration truck or explosives.

\subsection{SeismicDart Deployment and Retrieval}
First, the SeismicDarts are loaded onto to a UAV. 
Currently, a maximum of four sensors can be dropped in a single flight. 
The flight plan communicated to the UAV provides a GPS waypoint for each SmartDart. 
The UAV flies to and drops a SmartDart at each waypoint, then returns home. 

Deployment is only one part of a survey. Large surveys require moving and reusing sensors.  
Because SmartDarts are more expensive than standard geophones, rapid reuse is essential.
The UAV has an underslung hook for picking up a SeismicDart.
Retrieval is facilitated by attaching a wire loop to the SeismicDart tail.
 This loop provides a target 300 mm in diameter for the hook, yet still allows autonomous deployment, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:SeismicDart_DR}.
Currently, retrieval is performed by manually piloting the UAV, but the loop size is within the accuracy of a UAV equipped with RTK GPS.
%Automating retrieval is out of the scope of this paper.
